In the seventh grade when my mother suggested that I should join the golf team, I thought she had lost her mind. But as usual, my mother <u>**1**</u> in the end. I played on the middle-school golf team in the seventh and eighth grade. The summer before high school came, I was <u>**2**</u> to join the high school team.   

That summer I <u>**3**</u> almost every Sunday morning on the golf course with my <u>**4**</u> and too many afternoons with my mother. This <u>**5**</u> relationship with my parents <u>**6**</u> during my high school years. <u>**7**</u> you're walking down the freshly *mowed fairway*(修剪的平坦球道), looking out across miles of nothing but golf course, and looking up at the beautiful blue sky, you will realize what is <u>**8**</u> in life. My mom and I <u>**9**</u> many things in the middle of
a round of golf that we would never do at <u>**10**</u>, where she is Mom and I am an annoying teenager. On the golf course, we're just two people who <u>**11**</u> golf.   

During the past years golfing has become a part of my <u>**12**</u>. My friends know in the summer the place to find me is on the golf course. There is <u>**13**</u> I love more than a perfect autumn morning, riding around in a *golf cart*(球车) with my dad. Golf has <u>**14**</u> me and made me into the person I am today. And I have to <u>**15**</u> that all of it is thanks to my mom who made me join that middle-school golf team. In fact, she was right.

This is what I was told by a total stranger when I asked if she believed in angels, and if she had a story about them.  

" Well, I <u>**1**</u> one. I was 11 when I went with my <u>**2**</u> to Fern Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park. It was so <u>**3**</u> to look miles across the Rockies and thousands of feet below into the valley. While my parents were busy preparing lunch, I climbed over a wooden fence to get closer to the cliff edge for a better <u>**4**</u>."  

She looked at me, then she <u>**5**</u>." I began to walk down a little hill but soon started <u>**6**</u> on loose small stones. I fell down, but <u>**7**</u> going faster and faster to what seemed the <u>**8**</u> of the world. In seconds, I knew I was going to <u>**9**</u>. My feet and legs went first over the edge at <u>**10**</u> speed. Then suddenly I felt two hands <u>**11**</u> me and stop me dead. My heart was <u>**12**</u> and I slowly *inched*(谨慎地移动) my body back to where I could <u>**13**</u> make it back up the hill. My father was waiting there and <u>**14**</u> at me for having such a(n) <u>**15**</u>. I tried to tell him and my mom about the angel's <u>**16**</u> that saved my life,but to this day they don't <u>**17**</u> me. They thought I was just trying to <u>**18**</u> trouble with a made-up story."  

I parted from the stranger later, telling her that I believed every word of her <u>**19**</u>. Angels are everywhere. That's why I always ask people to <u>**20**</u> their miracles. Each real story makes my day.

### 2022.04.28.四

From a young age, I was taught to be kind to people around. My parents <u>**1**</u> explained to me the importance of giving help generously to the less <u>**2**</u>. So out of habit, whenever there is something I can <u>**3**</u> I give it to someone on the streets.   

Last week, as I left the house for work, I carried with me some <u>**4**</u> clothes, a handbag and some food to hand over to someone <u>**5**</u>.   

As the car <u>**6**</u> at a traffic red light, I saw a girl of five or six asking for money. I <u>**7**</u> her to come to me and quickly <u>**8**</u> all the *stuff*(物品) I had and put them into the handbag. As I started handing it over, she seemed <u>**9**</u> She looked up at me with a sweet smile on her face and asked what was in the <u>**10**</u>. I told her there were some clothes and food for her.   

Once again she <u>**11**</u> me,"Can you give me some water?" It was then that I noticed her dry lips. It seemed that she had not had a drop of water all day. I took out the water bottle that I always carry with me and helped her to drink from it. She finished it quickly and gave me a  heartwarming smile of <u>**12**</u>.   

I was thankful that I could <u>**13**</u> what she really wished and realized once again that day that you don't  necessarily have to make big donations to help someone. And this incident, as well as a lot that followed, <u>**14**</u> my belief in the simple acts of kindness and how they can make someone's day. Next time you want to do something nice for someone, don't <u>**15**</u> seizing the right opportunity, or it would be late. Go ahead and do it!
