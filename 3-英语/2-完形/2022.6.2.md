I worked for nine years at the most entertaining job in the world! My <u>**1**</u> was tiled “Childcare
Attendant” and I <u>**2**</u> with children all day at a children service in a large department store. The <u>**3**</u> happened to be located in the same city as the headquarters for an international company, which <u>**4**</u> people from all around the world. So <u>**5**</u> in its aisles were mothers and fathers from <u>**6**</u> parts of the world! And their preschool-aged children played together in our <u>**7**</u> playroom.

One day,a 4-year-old little girl from India <u>**8**</u> in the large playroom, but she did not know a word of
English! Only one other child was in the <u>**9**</u> a chatty 4-year-old American girl who was very <u>**10**</u> there. When she saw this other child, she became so happy and <u>**11**</u>!There were two playhouses in the room, and
she chattered on, <u>**12**</u> to her new friend—who could not <u>**13**</u> a word, but was also happy and excited that they play “neighbors”. <u>**14**</u> she signaled that one house was her new friend’s, and then she
ran to her own house. 

Shortly afterwards, they both <u>**15**</u> can out of their homes, waving their little arms and cheering, and the American child <u>**16**</u> “I LOVE YOU!” to the other as her <u>**17**</u> also screamed, “I LOVE YOU!” Then they hugged and hugged as if they had <u>**18**</u> each other all their lives!

I was the only one who <u>**19**</u> that and these many years later I have never <u>**20**</u> it.
